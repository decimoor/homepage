            <p>So, apparently I am a big dreamer, as said V in a Cyberpunk trailer revealed at E3 2018 (that old good times). I like dreaming because that makes me happy. I can easily spend hours dreaming about the future, about people around and far-far away. I like dreaming because it is some kind of escape from reality thing. I can tell about huge amount of my dreams but it considered that at this page i should speak about my dreams touching IT career. So let’s dive in! </p>

                <img src="../images/v.jpg" alt="" id="v-img">
                <p class="image-desc">
                    Look at this handsome
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="sect-header">
                Near
            </p>
            <p>In the near future I would like to finish this course and this web site because I've been putting off this business too many times. I would feel quite free when I give this work to cs50. The certificate from this course also is in my dreams cause in can easily cheer me up. Also I want to finish “Creating your own messenger” course made by my professor (I guess in US he would be called that). Though I dislike the way he teaches in that I think that if I put enough effort I will easily finish it and get A mark from professor in advance (let’s cross the fingers).</p>
            <p class="sect-header">
                A little bit far
            </p>
            <p>After that I think it would be very good if I find some work in a good IT company where I will feel happy and content (also my workplace must have free orange juice, it is very important). I do not think I will get a high paying job but I do not wish to get that one. Being a junior is enough for me in a couple of years, but I promise to myself I won’t stand still, I will keep upgrading my skills and becoming better to achieve and make even  more dreams true.</p>
            <p class="sect-header">
                In a far-far future
            </p>
            <p>Here we go, my most cherished dreams. I don’t think I will make them true but thinking about them makes me so happy and glad. In my dreams I see myself having my own start-up where I spent hours and hours working with the closest people that means a lot to me. We are all the time together having fun and working and working, sharing each other different ideas, discussing them. We travel through a different countries, go to IT expos where we show our projects. People all around the world will discuss them and try to make cooperation with us (or just buy us). The main thing about all this stuff is that people around should really MEAN something to me, inspire me and keep me going forward. s</p>
