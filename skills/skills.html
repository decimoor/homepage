            <p>There is not much of things I am capable of, but there is some skills i am proud of. Here are some of them:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Python in a beginner Level.</li>
                <li>C++. Almost everything in that language (my favourite one actually).</li>
                <li>Algorithms. I have some skills in an Olympic coding and reached level 8 at "coding game".</li>
                <li>STL. I know everything in that library.</li>
                <li>SQL. Actually I've found some thieves using that language you know...</li>
                <li>HTML. Not a big deal but anyway I know a lot of feauters of that NON programming language.</li>
                <li>CSS. At a very low level, unfortunatly.</li>
                <li>SFML library for C++. I have met with it a day ago but I am in love with that. I am sure I could do a lot of interesting things using it.</li>
                <li>5% of OpenGL API. I've spend about a month learning it but it is so hard...</li>
                <li>Math. It's not directly connected with IT but it help me a lot in solving problems.</li>

                <p>Let's talk about them a little bit closer.</p>
            </ol>
            <img src="../images/python-logo.png" alt="" class = "image" id="python-img">
            <p>That is my first programming language. I was 16 years old when I first tried this amazing language. To my dismay I didn't any big steps in learning it. The only thing I've learned is: how to use conditions, how to get input from user and give output to them. Nothing about arrays, while and for loops, interesting fucntions like map, reverse and math functions. Eventually I gave up and started watching anime BECOUSE THAT IS MY NINJA WAY ahem... Two years had passed and time of exams had come. To run over to Moscow from my little village I had to pass the exam at high level. So I begun preparing to them and found some courses that included learning Python's basics. In two month I discovered math operations, 2D arrays, string, data types, loops, loop in loop, complexitys of algorithms and basics of dynamic coding. That skills helped me to run over to Moscow and solve really hard problems (the last problem in a Russian exam for CS under the number 27 was really hard thing). In a University we continued learning that magestic language but teaching was not quite good so my knowledge in Python didn't go further. My last tries in Python were in CS50 courses where I discovered interesting feauters of Python which made me excited! I think in future I will lear that languge properly but now I've put it on hold.</p>

                <img src="../images/c++-log.png" alt=""  id="cpp-img">
            <p>My most lovely language. It is slowly dying becouse of modern languages that makes making of app a lot easier and faster, but it turns out that it is still the fastest OOP language ever created, so it won't die completly. I like it's syntaw, the way they made OOP conceptions and huge amount of frameworks and libraries. It takes a lot of space in my heart so i won't ever forget it </p>

            <img src="../images/sql-logo.jpg" alt=""  id="sql-image">
            <p>SQL is kinda good for anythin thing. Almost every serious project needs SQL for working with database. It gives an user a lot of features that make job quite easier. When I started working with it I was kinda surprised of how easy they made "pulling" info from databases comparing to build-in methods in c++ or python</p>
            <div class="seperator"></div>
            <p>Actually thats all! Another skills are not that big to be described </p>
