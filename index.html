                        My friend said i am handsome here

                <p>My name is Rashid and currently i am living and studying at moscow. Firts of all I want to confess that my knowledge in english is not quite large so some of proposals might sound kinda stupid.<br><br><br>
                    I think that acquaintance with people should start with visual contact. Since we can’t talk in person I will show you myself using this image.<br><br><br>
                    
                    To describe myself I like to use words like: shy, a little bit insane, chatty, curious about everything in this world. I like to be inspired, to meet new people with extraordinary minds and uncontrollable will to change the world around them and give it the peace of themself to let everyone remember. I like the morning rays of the son, the shining moon over sky, thunder in clouds, raindrops and twittering of birds.

                <p>Besides all the natural things I am in love with IT. I like learning new things, especially some “low level” details that were always “dark box” for me. Typing code and spending hours and hours testing it and finding different bugs.<br><br><br>

                    I don’t remember a lot about my childhood but I am sure about one thing - I have never liked to depend on someone. I love when I control every process around myself. It makes me more confident in my next minut, hour and day and this is very important to me. Being sure about the future - that is what I like. I guess this is why I want to know so much about computer’s hardware and low-level details.<br><br><br>
